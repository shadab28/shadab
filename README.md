Quant Portfolio Website

This is a small static portfolio site generated from a provided resume (Shadab_Quant.pdf). It contains sections: Home, About, Experience, Skills, Projects, Contact.

Quick start:
1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Edit content directly in `index.html` to update text, or replace the placeholder avatar in `assets/avatar.svg`.

Files:
- index.html — main page
- styles.css — site styles
- script.js — site interactivity and chart setup
- assets/avatar.svg — placeholder avatar

Notes:
- Chart uses Chart.js via CDN. No build step required.
- For deployment, host as static files (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, etc.).
